# An application simulating a traffic light by WPF and C#
A simple example of using WPF. To create the application were used several components:
- Button, GroupBox, Label, TextBox
- Ellipse, DispatcherTimer
- Grid, StackPanel, Canvas and combinations of it

The application can work in two modes: in the manual mode user switches lamps one by one by pressing the button,
in the automatic mode a timer helps to switch lamp. A user can define durations of glow of the lamps.
